## Description
The Climate Change Impact Simulator is a comprehensive project designed to use the extensive "Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data" from Berkeley Earth. By integrating this data with advanced climate models, the simulator aims to forecast the potential impacts of climate change on different regions. The main objective is to develop an interactive website that allows users to visualize the effects of climate change based on historical data and future projections. Leveraging AWS for computational power and data storage, this project seeks to provide a dynamic, user-friendly platform for understanding and analyzing the regional consequences of evolving climate patterns.
